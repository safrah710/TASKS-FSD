Certainly! Here's a comparison of HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 in a box format:

```
     HTTP/1.1                   |      HTTP/2         |

No Multiplexing               | Supports Multiplexing|
|                     |                     
| Headers not                     | Uses Header Compression|
| Compressed                              
|                     |                     
| Text-Based Protocol               | Binary Framing      |
|                     |                     
| No Server Push                   | Supports Server Push |
|                     |                     
| No Header                              | Supports Request    |
| Prioritization                                 | Prioritization       |
|                     |                     
| Multiple Connections                 | Single Multiplexed  |
| for Parallelism                             | Connection          |

This format provides a concise overview of the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

1. **Introduction:**
   JavaScript objects are dynamic entities crucial to the language's flexibility. They store and organize data, acting as a cornerstone for web development.

2. **Key Properties:**
   Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, enabling the storage of diverse data types and functions within a single entity.

3. **Internal Structure:**
   Internally, objects use a hash table-like structure for efficient data retrieval. Each key serves as an index, making property access quick and constant time.

4. **Reference Types:**
   Objects are reference types, pointing to memory locations rather than holding the actual values. Understanding this is vital for avoiding unexpected behaviors.

5. **Prototypes and Inheritance:**
   JavaScript objects support prototype-based inheritance. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, fostering code reuse and a hierarchical structure.

6. **Object Creation:**
   Objects can be created through literal notation (`{}`) or the `new Object()` constructor. ES6 introduced class syntax, providing syntactic sugar for object creation.

7. **Dynamic Nature:**
   Objects are highly dynamic; properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime. This adaptability makes them powerful for handling changing data structures.

8. **JSON Representation:**
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) closely resembles the object literal syntax. Understanding the internal representation aids in efficient data manipulation and serialization.
